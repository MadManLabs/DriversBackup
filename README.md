# DriversBackup
Drivers Backup allows you to save your drivers locally. It was created in order to help Windows users during re-installation process. Or if you want to transfer one driver from your device to another. It can be used on Windows 7 or higher on any PC or Windows tablet.
# Vision of the feature
Currently the app is WPF, so it works on Windows 7 or higher. I want to remake this app as UWP and publish it on Win Store, so Windows 10 users can download it more easily. The WPF version will be kept for the users of older versions of Windows.
## Scheduled features
* Cloud backup - backup your drivers in a cloud
* Periodicall backup - backup your drivers every day
* Differential backup - backup your drivers, when new drivers are installed
