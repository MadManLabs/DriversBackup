# DriversBackup
Drivers Backup allows you to save your drivers locally. It was created in order to help Windows users during re-installation process. Or if you want to transfer one driver from your device to another. It can be used on Windows 7 or higher on any PC or Windows tablet.
# Vision of the feature
Currently the app is WPF, so it works on Windows 7 or higher. I want to publish it on Win Store, so Windows 10 users can download it more easily. I am planning to add a cloud backend for saving the drivers in a cloud and thus allow sharing between computers.
## Scheduled features
* Cloud backup - backup your drivers in a cloud
* Periodicall backup - backup your drivers every day
* Differential backup - backup your drivers, when new drivers are installed
